We like Pulp. A lot.

We also like our users. We like them a lot too.

We like them so much that we wanted a way to combine the two. A way to freely and frequently share Pulp information, news, tips, and demos. That&#8217;s where this developer blog comes in.

The intention of this blog is to keep the community informed of Pulp progress and advances. Things such as&#8230;

  * Pulp Feature &#8220;Spotlights&#8221;, focusing on demonstrating various Pulp features to meet user needs.
  * Release information, including release notes and bug fixes.
  * Developer-centric articles discussing implementation and opportunities for contributors
  * And more&#8230;

If by some chance you stumbled here without knowing what Pulp is, here is the obligatory series of links to various related project sites:

  * [User Guide](http://pulpproject.org/ug/)
  * [Installation Instructions](http://pulpproject.org/ug/UGInstallation.html#installation)

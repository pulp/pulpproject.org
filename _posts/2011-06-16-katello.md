As alluded to previously, although Pulp is fully functional as a standalone application, it is also integral in a new systems management initiative. The [Katello](http://www.katello.org) project combines concepts such as software updates, subscription management, provisioning, and configuration into a single front end including both web and CLI interfaces. Their newly launched site provides more information on the underlying projects it unites as well as screenshots and contact information:

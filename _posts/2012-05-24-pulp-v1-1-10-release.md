A bug fix and minor feature enhancement release has been built to the v1 stable repository (<http://repos.fedorapeople.org/repos/pulp/pulp/v1/stable/>). The fixed bug list is available below.

## Upgrades Prior to 1.0.4

The package structure on disk changed in the 1.0.4 release. A script was provided in that release to migrate existing content. If upgrading from a 1.0.4 instance this script **does not need to be run again.**

Upgrading from versions prior to 1.0.4 however **must run the migration script** to avoid duplicating content on disk. Instructions on running that script can be found [on the Pulp wiki.](https://fedorahosted.org/pulp/wiki/PackagePathUpdate#Howtorunmigration)

## v2 Community Releases

We&#8217;re nearing the point of being able to release a preview build of the v2 codebase. It won&#8217;t be complete (for instances, CDS support is entirely missing at the moment and will be undergoing a pretty drastic redesign) but it should give some transparency into what is planned for Pulp&#8217;s future. My current plan for this release is to target July 1st. More news to follow as it gets closer.

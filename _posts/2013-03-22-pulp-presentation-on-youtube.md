On March 14, I presented Pulp to the <a href="http://trilug.org" title="Triangle Linux User Group" target="_blank">Triangle Linux User Group</a> in Raleigh, NC. In addition to an overview of what Pulp does and how its pieces fit together, I talked about some of the upcoming 2.1 features such as Pulp Nodes. I also included a demo of the new Puppet consumer features.

You can watch a video of the presentation <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&#038;v=DlBQW2TZcZc#t=1577s" title="Pulp Presentation to TriLUG" target="_blank">here</a>. Skip ahead to 26 minutes for my portion of the meeting.

TriLUG is a very active user group with a wide variety of impressively-talented people and consistently well-attended meetings. The TriLUG email list has been a tremendous resource for me over the years, and it was a pleasure to be this month&#8217;s presenter. If you would like to watch future meetings online, look for the &#8220;Triangle Linux User Group&#8221; on <a href="https://plus.google.com/u/0/100966474210194014634/" title="Triangle Linux User Group" target="_blank">Google+</a> and join the live Hangout.

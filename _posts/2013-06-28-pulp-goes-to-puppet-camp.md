Last month I was invited to Puppet Camp Raleigh to do a presentation on how to manage Puppet modules and repositories using Pulp. Thank to Puppet Labs for the invitation, and for putting on a very nice event in Raleigh. It was an all-day event featuring speakers from Puppet Labs, Citrix, Juniper, Red Hat, and GitHub presenting to a crowd of about 150.

Video of my presentation is available [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryxXFFYQqLI "Hosting a Custom Forge with Pulp").

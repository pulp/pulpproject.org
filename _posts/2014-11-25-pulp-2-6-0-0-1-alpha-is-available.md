Pulp 2.6.0-0.1.alpha is available in the testing repositories.

This alpha release includes bugfixes and support for RabbitMQ.

Starting with Pulp 2.6.0 alpha, releases will be GPG signed by the Pulp team. If you use the repo files from the <a href="http://pulp.readthedocs.org/en/latest/user-guide/installation.html" target="_blank">installation page</a> and enable the _pulp-2.6-testing_ repo, this should be configured correctly by default.

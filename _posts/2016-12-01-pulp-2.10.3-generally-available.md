Pulp 2.10.3 is now Generally Available in the stable repositories:

* [pulp-2-stable](https://repos.fedorapeople.org/pulp/pulp/stable/2/)
* [pulp-stable](https://repos.fedorapeople.org/pulp/pulp/stable/latest/)

This release includes bug fixes for the Pulp Platform, and the RPM Plugin.


## Upgrading

The Pulp stable repositories are included in the pulp repo files:

* <https://repos.fedorapeople.org/repos/pulp/pulp/fedora-pulp.repo> for fedora 23 & 24
* <https://repos.fedorapeople.org/repos/pulp/pulp/rhel-pulp.repo> for RHEL 6 & 7

After enabling the `pulp-2-stable` repository, you'll want to follow the standard
upgrade path with migrations:

```sh
$ sudo systemctl stop httpd pulp_workers pulp_resource_manager pulp_celerybeat
$ sudo yum upgrade
$ sudo -u apache pulp-manage-db
$ sudo systemctl start httpd pulp_workers pulp_resource_manager pulp_celerybeat
```

## el6 Known Issue Update

In the beta announcement for this release, I mentioned that the el6 test suite
was indicating that this release might be unstable for that platform.

The el6 release has since been verified as working and cleared for release, as
[reported here](https://pulp.plan.io/projects/pulp/wiki/Pulp_2_10_3_Test_Result_Summary).

Thanks to everyone involved in this investigation.

Pulp 2.11.0 is now Generally Available in the stable repositories

* [pulp-2-stable](https://repos.fedorapeople.org/pulp/pulp/stable/2/)
* [pulp-stable](https://repos.fedorapeople.org/pulp/pulp/stable/latest/)

Upgrading
=========

The Pulp stable repositories are included in the pulp repo files:
<https://repos.fedorapeople.org/repos/pulp/pulp/fedora-pulp.repo> for fedora 23 & 24
<https://repos.fedorapeople.org/repos/pulp/pulp/rhel-pulp.repo> for RHEL 6 & 7

After enabling the `pulp-stable` or `pulp-2-stable` repository, you'll want to follow the standard
upgrade path, with migrations:

```sh
$ sudo systemctl stop httpd pulp_workers pulp_resource_manager pulp_celerybeat pulp_streamer
$ sudo yum upgrade
$ sudo -u apache pulp-manage-db
$ sudo systemctl start httpd pulp_workers pulp_resource_manager pulp_celerybeat pulp_streamer
```

Pulp 2.12.1 is now Generally Available in the stable repositories:

* [pulp-2-stable](https://repos.fedorapeople.org/pulp/pulp/stable/2/)
* [pulp-stable](https://repos.fedorapeople.org/pulp/pulp/stable/latest/)

This release includes bug fixes for the Pulp Platform and the RPM Plugin.

There were 2 potential blockers filed during the 2.12.1 beta: [#2591](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/2591) and
[#2600](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/2600). #2591 was resolved by the user, and #2600 was a beta packaging issue.
Thus this release is unchanged from the 2.12.1 Beta 1 release.


## Upgrading

The Pulp 2 stable repositories are included in the pulp repo files:

- [Fedora 24 & 25](https://repos.fedorapeople.org/repos/pulp/pulp/fedora-pulp.repo)
- [RHEL 7](https://repos.fedorapeople.org/repos/pulp/pulp/rhel-pulp.repo)

After enabling the pulp-stable or pulp-2-stable repository, you'll want to follow the standard
upgrade path with migrations:

```sh
$ sudo systemctl stop httpd pulp_workers pulp_resource_manager pulp_celerybeat pulp_streamer goferd
$ sudo yum upgrade
$ sudo -u apache pulp-manage-db
$ sudo systemctl start httpd pulp_workers pulp_resource_manager pulp_celerybeat pulp_streamer goferd
```

The `pulp_streamer` and `goferd` services should be omitted if those services are not installed.

## el6 Support Reminder

As mentioned previously, Pulp no longer supports el6 starting with 2.12.

Pulp users running on RHEL or CentOS 6 are recommended to upgrade their Pulp server to
the current major version of that OS, RHEL or CentOS 7.

Pulp 2.14.0 is now generally available, and can be downloaded from the 2.14 stable repositories:

* [pulp-2-stable](https://repos.fedorapeople.org/pulp/pulp/stable/2/)
* [pulp-stable](https://repos.fedorapeople.org/pulp/pulp/stable/latest/)

New features for Pulp 2.14 include new features added to the Pulp platform, as well as the Puppet, RPM, Python, and Docker plugins. Many bug fixes are also included in the 2.14.0 release.

More information about these new features can be found in the features list below, as well as in the [2.14 release notes](http://docs.pulpproject.org/en/2.14/user-guide/release-notes/2.14.x.html)

[Pulp Debian Docs](https://github.com/pulp/pulp_deb/#debian-support)

Try out the new features, and let us know how they work for you!

## New Plugin:  Pulp Debian

With this release we have included an updated Pulp Debian plugin courtesy of our community contibutor Mihai Ibanescu!

This plugin should enable you to work with debian repositories

## Fedora 26 Support:  https://pulp.plan.io/issues/2961

We hoped to bring Fedora 26 support in with this release, but there are still some issues with pulp on Fedora 26.  

We are looking at resolving these, and will hopefully be able to provide Fedora 26 builds either shortly after this release, or with the 2.14.1 release.

## Upgrading

The Pulp 2 stable repository is included in the pulp repo files:

- [Fedora 24 & 25](https://repos.fedorapeople.org/repos/pulp/pulp/fedora-pulp.repo)
- [RHEL 7](https://repos.fedorapeople.org/repos/pulp/pulp/rhel-pulp.repo)

After enabling the pulp-stable or pulp-2-stable repository, you'll want to follow the standard upgrade path with migrations:

```sh
$ sudo systemctl stop httpd pulp_workers pulp_resource_manager pulp_celerybeat pulp_streamer goferd
$ sudo yum upgrade
$ sudo -u apache pulp-manage-db
$ sudo systemctl start httpd pulp_workers pulp_resource_manager pulp_celerybeat pulp_streamer goferd
```
The `pulp_streamer` and `goferd` services should be omitted if those services are not installed.

## End of EL6 Support

As mentioned in the 2.11.0 release notes, Pulp no longer supports el6 starting with 2.12.

Pulp users running on RHEL or CentOS 6 are recommended to upgrade their Pulp server to the current major version of that OS, RHEL or CentOS 7.

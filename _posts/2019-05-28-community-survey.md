Today we are asking for community feedback in our second Pulp Community Survey. [The feedback we
received in our first community
survey](https://pulpproject.org/2017/08/08/community-survey-results/) provided valuable insights
into how our users use Pulp. For our second Community Survey, we hope to also get feedback into how
we can improve the upcoming Pulp 3 release from users, contributors, and other community members.

We're giving away Pulp gear (t-shirt, socks, stickers, etc) to anyone who fills out the survey.
More importantly, by filling out the survey, you'll help us to improve Pulp. So if you have a few
minutes, please visit the link below to fill out the survey.

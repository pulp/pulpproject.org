* [pulp_file 0.1](https://pulp-file.readthedocs.io/en/0.1.0/) to manage Files

These plugins are compatible with the [pulpcore 3.0.0](https://docs.pulpproject.org/) release which
is also Generally Available today!

## Installation

See the installation docs (links below) for each plugin on how to install. They all use the same
installer so they are very similar. Plugins are capable of being installed all together on one
installation.

* [pulp_rpm installation](https://pulp-rpm.readthedocs.io/en/3.0/installation.html)
* [pulp_container installation](https://pulp-container.readthedocs.io/en/1.0/installation.html)
* [pulp_file installation](https://pulp-file.readthedocs.io/en/0.1.0/installation.html)


## Quickstart

Pulp_rpm offers a [quickstart guide](https://pulp-rpm.readthedocs.io/en/3.0/quickstart.html) which
uses [pulplift](https://github.com/pulp/pulplift) to create a not-long-living installation just to
try it out. These same instructions can be adapted to the other plugins also.


## Migrating from Pulp2 -> Pulp3

A [Pulp 2 -> Pulp 3 migration tool is in-progress](https://github.com/pulp/pulp-2to3-migration),
but not fully available yet. Until it is, users are recommended to:

* **not** install Pulp3 on top of their Pulp2 system until it is available

We hope this tool will be available within a month or two to migrate the plugin types that are
released.


## Why these version numbers?

These Pulp plugins use [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/), so the different version numbers
have different meanings summarized below.

* pulp_rpm is 3.0 to indicate future releases will not contain API breaking changes, and it's the
  next major release after pulp_rpm 2.y
* pulp_container uses 1.0 to indicate future releases will not contain API breaking changes, but it
  is overall a new plugin.
* pulp_file uses 0.1 to indicate future Y-releases may contain API backwards incompatible breaking
  changes, and it is a new plugin.

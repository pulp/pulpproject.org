There have been some big changes to Pulp Installer in 3.5.0, in terms of the Ansible role structure,
including breaking changes. Merely reading the release notes for individual changes does not paint
a complete or clear picture, hence why we are writing this blog post.

In short, we refactored the Pulp Installer roles to acheive an SOA (Service Oriented Architecture).

We now have 1 role for each service, and each can be installed to a server of its own.

This does mean that users who wrote custom playbooks need to update them for 3.5.0 with a new `roles:` list.

So we created 2 new meta roles as well, to prevent users from having to change their `roles:` list
again in the future:
* `pulp_all_services`
* `pulp_services`

The refactoring benefits every deployment scenario that users may have, 4 of which are explained
in greater detail with example playbooks below.
* Users that want a single "all-in-one" Pulp server (including database, redis & webserver).
* Users that want to install Pulp itself on a server, but want to use existing
  infrastructure (servers) for database, redis & webserver.
* Users that want to install Pulp itself on a server, and want to install database, redis &
  webserver on separate servers.
* User that wants to install each and every Pulp service on a separate server.

### "All-In-One" Pulp Server:

This is a single server, containing all Pulp services, including database, redis & webserver.

This is the new example playbook, almost identical to the one found in
pulp_installer/playbooks/example-use/playbook.yml and in the quickstart guide in the Pulp Installer
docs.

The benefits / differences from 3.4.1 are:
* The old `roles:` list (with 5 roles) will no longer work.
* The new `roles:` list is now 1 meta role: `pulp_all_services`
* The new `roles:` list is very unlikely to change again in the future.

```yaml
    ---
    - hosts: pulp1
      vars:
        pulp_default_admin_password: << YOUR PASSWORD FOR THE PULP APPLICATION HERE >>
        pulp_settings:
          secret_key: << YOUR SECRET HERE >>
          content_origin: "http://{{ ansible_fqdn }}"
        pulp_install_plugins:
          pulp-container: {}
          pulp-rpm: {}
      roles:
        - pulp_all_services
      environment:
        DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE: pulpcore.app.settings
```

### Pulp Server with Existing Infrastructure:

This is a single server, that relies on existing database, redis & webservers.

This example playbook is almost identical to the one found in the `pulp_services` documentation.

The benefits / differences from 3.4.1 are:
* The old `roles:` list (with 4 roles) will no longer work.
* The new `roles:` list is now 1 meta role: `pulp_services`.
* The new `roles:` list is unlikely to change again in the future.
* `pulp_redis` will no longer be applied on this server as a dependency
  of `pulp_workers` or `pulp_resource_manager`. This avoids an additional & unused redis service
  being pointlessly installed and running.
* Telling the installer to not install a postgres database server is now a function of the `roles:`
  list. The following variable which used to control that is now ignored: `pulp_install_db`.
* Therefore, you no longer need to set `pulp_install_db=false` in your `vars:`.

```yaml
    ---
    - hosts: pulp1
      vars:
        pulp_default_admin_password: << YOUR PASSWORD FOR THE PULP APPLICATION HERE >>
        pulp_content_bind: pulp1:24816
        pulp_api_bind: pulp1:24817
        pulp_settings:
          secret_key: << YOUR SECRET HERE >>
          content_origin: "http://webserver1.fqdn"
          redis_host: redis1
          redis_port: 6379
          redis_password: << YOUR REDIS PASSWORD HERE >>
          databases:
            default:
              HOST: postgres1
              ENGINE: django.db.backends.postgresql_psycopg2
              NAME: pulp
              USER: pulp
              PASSWORD: << YOUR DATABASE PASSWORD HERE >>
        pulp_install_plugins:
          pulp-container: {}
          pulp-rpm: {}
      roles:
        - pulp_services
      environment:
        DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE: pulpcore.app.settings
```

Note the following hostnames:
* pulp1: The Pulp server
* webserver1.fqdn : An existing webserver, specified as FQDN, and with http:// or https://
* redis1: An existing redis server
* postgres1: An existing PostgreSQL database server

### Pulp Server + Separate Servers

Here the installer installs Pulp itself on a server, the database on a 2nd server, redis on
a 3rd server, and the webserver on a 4th server.

Note that the code for `hosts: pulp1` is identical to the above example.

We consider this to be a new deployment scenario for Pulp Installer, because although it may have
worked previously, odd settings/workarounds were involved (we listed the ones we noticed
below), and it was never tested or documented.

The benefits / differences from 3.4.1 are:
* The new `roles:` list for the main Pulp server is now 1 meta role: `pulp_services`.
* The new `roles:` list for the main Pulp server is also unlikely to change in the future.
* `pulp_redis` (and thus a redis server) will no longer be installed on the main Pulp server as a
  dependency of `pulp_workers` or `pulp_resource_manager`. This avoids a pointless service being
  installed and running on it.
* When you apply `pulp_database` to install the Posgres database server, it no longer installs the
  Pulp application on it (it no longer depends on `pulp_common`, formerly `pulp`.) This is because the
  functionality to configure the database itself is no longer in `pulp_database`. It is now
  in `pulp_database_config`, which is a dependency of `pulp_services`.
* You no longer need to set `pulp_install_api_service=false` and `pulp_install_db=false` on postgres1
  and webserver1.
* Because of the above change, the following variables are now ignored: `pulp_install_api_service`
  and `pulp_install_db`.

Note that the following non-SOA behavior still exists:
* `pulp_webserver` still depends on `pulp_common` (formerly `pulp`), so as to provide the
  per-plugin webserver snippets. So webserver1 will have pulpcore & all plugins installed on it.
  Now however, pulp-api is no longer running & listening by default
  (no need to set `pulp_install_api_service=false`.)

```yaml
    ---
    - hosts: postgres1
      vars:
        pulp_settings:
          databases:
            default:
              HOST: postgres1
              NAME: pulp
              USER: pulp
              PASSWORD: << YOUR DATABASE PASSWORD HERE >>
      roles:
        - pulp_database

    - hosts: redis1
      vars:
        pulp_redis_bind: 'redis1:6379'
      roles:
        - pulp_redis

    - hosts: pulp1
      vars:
        pulp_default_admin_password: << YOUR PASSWORD FOR THE PULP APPLICATION HERE >>
        pulp_content_bind: pulp1:24816
        pulp_api_bind: pulp1:24817
        pulp_settings:
          secret_key: << YOUR SECRET HERE >>
          content_origin: "http://webserver1.fqdn"
          redis_host: redis1
          redis_port: 6379
          databases:
            default:
              HOST: postgres1
              ENGINE: django.db.backends.postgresql_psycopg2
              NAME: pulp
              USER: pulp
              PASSWORD: << YOUR DATABASE PASSWORD HERE >>
        pulp_install_plugins:
          pulp-container: {}
          pulp-rpm: {}
      roles:
        - pulp_services
      environment:
        DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE: pulpcore.app.settings

    - hosts: webserver1
      vars:
        pulp_content_bind: pulp1:24816
        pulp_api_bind: pulp1:24817
      roles:
        - pulp_webserver
```

Note the following hostnames:
* pulp1: The Pulp server
* webserver1.fqdn : The new webserver, specified as FQDN, and with http:// or https://
* webserver1: The same new webserver
* redis1: The new redis server
* postgres1: The new PostgreSQL database server

### Separate Servers for Each & Every service

Here every single service is on its own server.

And in the example playbook, there are actually 2 worker servers.

We consider this to be a new deployment scenario for Pulp Installer, because although it may have
worked previously, odd settings/workarounds were involved (we listed the ones we noticed
below), and it was never tested or documented.

`pulp_services` is expanded from the previous example 5 roles: `pulp_api`, `pulp_content`, `pulp_workers`,
`pulp_resource_manager` and  `pulp_database_config`. `pulp_database_config` is actually not a
service, but it does depend on `pulp_common` (which installs the Pulp application) and it only needs
to be run once. It can be run on any server (ideally one where `pulp_common` is being run for other
roles anyway), so we simply picked the API server.

The benefits / differences from 3.4.1 are:
* The new `roles:` list is 1 role per service and per server, plus `pulp_database_config`.
* `pulp-api` is now its own role. It is no longer part of `pulp` (now called `pulp_common`).
* `pulp_common` (formerly `pulp`) is not meant to be called directly anymore, either as an
  undeclared dependency or for the `pulp-api` service.
* `pulp_redis` (and thus a redis server) will no longer be installed on the pulp_workers servers or
  pulp-res-man1 server as a dependency of `pulp_workers` or `pulp_resource_manager`. This avoids a
  pointless service being installed and running on them.
* When you apply `pulp_database` to install the Posgres database server, it no longer installs the
  Pulp application on it (it no longer depends on `pulp_common`, formerly `pulp`.) This is because the
  functionality to configure the database itself is no longer in `pulp_database`. It is now
  in `pulp_database_config`, which is a dependency of `pulp_services`.
* You no longer need to set `pulp_install_api_service=false` on all the servers other than
  pulp-api1.
* You no longer need to set `pulp_install_db=false` on postgres1
* Because of the above changes, the following variables are now ignored: `pulp_install_api_service`
  and `pulp_install_db`.

Note that the following non-SOA behavior still exists:
* `pulp_webserver` still depends on `pulp_common` (formerly `pulp`), so as to provide the
  per-plugin webserver snippets. So webserver1 will have pulpcore & all plugins installed on it.
  Now however, pulp-api is no longer running & listening by default
  (no need to set `pulp_install_api_service=false`.)

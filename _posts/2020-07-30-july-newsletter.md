## Pulpcore 3.5 is available

As well as a number of bug fixes, this release contains major updates to the Pulp installer to achieve Service Oriented Architecture (SOA). With this release, there is one role per service, which means that you can install each service on an individual server. Because of the scale of these changes, this release introduces some breaking changes. As part of the upgrade, you must also update existing playbooks.  For more information, see [Pulp Installer 3.5 new roles and new deployment scenarios](https://pulpproject.org/2020/07/09/pulp-3.5-installer-roles/)

The following features have been added to the REST API:

* By default, Pulp now provides a user agent with all `aiohttp` requests to identify itself.
* A `start_versions=`  has been added so export a specific set of repository versions. For more information, see [Exporting Incrementally](https://docs.pulpproject.org/en/3.5/workflows/import-export.html?highlight=start_versions#exporting-incrementally) in the Pulp documentation.
* GroupProgressReport has been added to track the progress of each task in that group. For more information, see *GroupProgressReport can* in the [Tasks](https://docs.pulpproject.org/plugins/plugin-writer/concepts/index.html#tasks) concept section of the Plugin Writers Guide

The following features have been added to the Plugin API:

* OpenAPI Tags have been added to group operations into logical categories. You can also customize tags. For more information. see [OpenAPI Tags](https://docs.pulpproject.org/plugins/reference/how-to-doc-api.html?highlight=group%20operations%20logically%20categories#openapi-tags)

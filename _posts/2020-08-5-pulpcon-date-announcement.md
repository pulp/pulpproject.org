We are glad to announce that PulpCon will take place during the week of September 14th.
The sessions will be held over 5 half-days, Mon-Fri mornings in EST and afternoons in CET.

Currently, we are collecting potential topics to discuss and voting on them. Please add topics you are interested in to [this doc](https://hackmd.io/@pulp/pulpcon2020/) or add your +1 to the existing ones.

If you would like to present your own work related to Pulp, your own plugin or any tooling around Pulp, feel free to add your name and project as a topic. We'll be happy to hear about your experience and allocate a slot for you in the schedule.

The topic submission and voting will close on August 15, 2020.

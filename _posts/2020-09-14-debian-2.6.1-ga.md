Recently, the Pulp 3 Debian plugin 2.6.1 was released. After eight beta versions, this is the first GA release.

Let's take a look at the Debian plugin's main features:

* Ability to synchronize all or a subset of an upstream repository
* Support for the manual upload of files to a `pulp_deb` repository
* A public GPG key can be used to verify upstream `Release` files
* Simple and structured publishing options
* Use a signing service to sign your simple and/or structured publications
* Verbatim publishing to recreate the synchronized subset of an upstream repository exactly
* Support for various Debian content types. Each content type has its own [REST API endpoint](https://docs.pulpproject.org/pulp_deb/restapi.html)

The Pulp 3 Debian [documentation](https://docs.pulpproject.org/pulp_deb/) is robust and contains example workflows.

## Workflow

There are two options in the workflow:
1. Create a remote and repository and then synchronize the Debian content from the remote to the repository.
2. Create a repository and manually upload a file to that repository.

After this, you can create a publication and a distribution so that your content is consumable by a package manager.

## Install

You can find the Debian plugin on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/pulp-deb/2.6.1/).

Check out the [installation instructions](https://docs.pulpproject.org/pulp_deb/installation.html).

You can find all the bindings [here](https://docs.pulpproject.org/pulp_deb/bindings.html).

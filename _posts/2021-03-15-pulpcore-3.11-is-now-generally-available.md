## New in Pulp 3.11

Let's take a look at the main features of this release.

### New Artifacts Checksum Reports [#7986](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/7986)

You can now evaluate how many content units are affected by a checksum type change by using the 'pulpcore-manager handle-artifact-checksums --report' command.

You can simply run this command, or run it with the `--checksums` and include a comma-sseparated list of the checksums that you want to use.

With this report, you can preview the impact of any change you want to make before you change the setting.

This new feature is currently a tech preview.


### Proxy Authorization Updates [#8167](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8167)
In previous versions of Pulp, the only way to specify a proxy username and password was to append them in the `proxy_url` fields.

With this release, there are two new fields: `proxy_username` and `proxy_password` for remotes that you can use to enter your credentials. As a result of this change, you can no longer specify credentials as part of the `proxy_url` field.
A data migration will move the proxy authentication information on existing remotes to the new fields.

### Worker timeout is now configurable [#8291](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8291)

In previous versions of Pulp, worker timeout was hardcoded as 30 seconds. Depending on the system, and the I/O of Postgresql, this hardcoded value caused problems.

As part of this release, a new setting `WORKER_TTL` has been added. You can specify the interval, in seconds, that you consider a worker as missing after its last heartbeat. The default value is 30 seconds.

You can edit the `WORKER_TTL` setting in `settings.py`.


### QueryExistingArtifacts now enforces ALLOWED_CONTENT_CHECKSUMS [#7854](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/7854)

An error will now occur if you sync content that includes a checksum that is not part of `ALLOWED_CONTENT_CHECKSUMS`.

### handle-artifact-checksums - now fully supported [#7928](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/7928)

 The `handle-artifact-checksums`, command, which was introduced as a tech preview is now a fully-supported part of Pulp 3.

### Update to `/pulp/api/v3/status/`

In earlier versions of Pulp plugins, `/pulp/api/v3/status/` listed Python package names instead of Django app names.

With this release, the `component` field of the `versions` section of the status API `/pulp/api/v3/status/` now lists the Django app name, not the Python package name. Similarly the OpenAPI schema at `/pulp/api/v3` does also. To support this change, plugins are required to supply their label and version in the `PulpPluginAppConfig` since 3.10. [#8198](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8198)


## Removals

The following items have been removed from Pulpcore as part of this release:


### Sensitive data removed from Remote responses [#8202](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8202)
Removed sensitive fields `username`, `password`, and `client_key` from Remote responses. You can still set and update these fields, but they will no longer be readable.

### Removed `md5` and `sha1` from ALLOWED_CONTENT_CHECKSUMS [#8246](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8246)

The `md5` and `sha1` checksums have been removed from the`ALLOWED_CONTENT_CHECKSUMS` setting because they are insecure.

With this release, the default `ALLOWED_CONTENT_CHECKSUMS` contain `sha224`, `sha256`,`sha384`, and `sha512`.

#### Systems with existing Artifacts will undergo an automatic update as part of this release [#8322](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8322)

Due to the removal of `md5` and `sha1` from the `ALLOWED_CONTENT_CHECKSUMS` setting, every system that had any Artifacts synced prior to Pulpcore 3.11 will have to run the `pulpcore-manager handle-content-checksums` command. This release provides an automatic data migration that will run the command automatically as part of the ``pulpcore-manager migrate`` command all upgrades must run anyway.


### The key field of SigningService [#8398](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8398)

The `key` field from the **SigningService** response has been removed. The **SigningService** contains the key information in the `public_key` field already.

## Addressing AccessPolicy via the viewset's classname[#8397](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8397)

The ability to address `AccessPolicy` using the viewset's classname. Use the Viewset's `urlpattern` instead.

## Plugin developer updates [#7815](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/7815)

This release includes the following updates to the plugin API.

Plugin developers now have the flexibility to use more than one `WorkingDirectory()` within a task, which includes nested calls. Tasks will also now use a temporary working directory by default.

### Use `pulpcore.app.pulp_hashlib` instead of `hashlib.new` [#7984](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/7984)

A new `pulpcore.app.pulp_hashlib` module has been added, which provides the `new` function and ensures that only allowed hashes listed in `ALLOWED_CONTENT_CHECKSUMS` can be instantiated. Plugin writers should use this instead of ``hashlib.new`` to generate checksum hashers.


### New method for querying content [#8375](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8375)

Add a ``get_content`` method to `pulpcore.plugin.models.RepositoryVersion` that accepts a queryset and returns a list of content in that repository using the given queryset.
This allows for specific content type to be returned by executing `repo_version.get_content(content_qs=MyContentType.objects)`.


## Plugin API Removals

* Adjusted the ``ALLOWED_CONTENT_CHECKSUMS`` setting to remove ``md5`` and ``sha1`` because they are insecure. Now, by default, the `ALLOWED_CONTENT_CHECKSUMS` contain `sha224`, `sha256`, `sha384`, and `sha512`. [#8246](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8246)
* Removed the unused `get_plugin_storage_path` method. [#8343](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8343)


### Plugin API Deprecations

The `pulpcore.plugin.tasking.WorkingDirectory` has been deprecated. [#8231](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8231)

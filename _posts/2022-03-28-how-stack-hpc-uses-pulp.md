StackHPC have written a very comprehensive case study about how the Centos Stream announcement impacted them and motivated them to prioritize a project to improve their "release train".

Pulp plays a critical role in ensuring the stability and repeatability of their deployment.

If you're looking to understand how all the pieces fit together, check out Mark Goddard's article [All Aboard the Release Train](https://stackhpc.com/all-aboard-the-release-train.html)

StackHPC have built upon Pulp Squeezer and have an [Ansible collection](https://galaxy.ansible.com/stackhpc/pulp) that you can use to build out your own solution.

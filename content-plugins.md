## Content Plugins

As part of the Pulp installation, you must add a content plugin for each content type that you want
to manage.
The following sections contain information about the available content plugins for both Pulp 2 and
Pulp 3. If you do not find the plugin for the content type you want to manage, consider
[writing a plugin](https://docs.pulpproject.org/plugins/plugin-writer/index.html).

## Plugin Changes between Pulp 2 and Pulp 3

* The ISO content support found in the Pulp 2 RPM plugin is now provided by the File plugin.
* The Docker plugin in Pulp 2 has been replaced by the Container plugin.
* Currently, there are no Pulp 3 plugins for Puppet and OSTree content.

## Pulp 3 CLI Coverage

The [Pulp 3 CLI](https://github.com/pulp/pulp-cli) is a work in progress.
The CLI is implemented by the plugin writers, so the workflows that are possible with the CLI vary
from plugin to plugin.
At the moment, these plugins have the following coverage:

* **RPM**: Sync workflow
* **File**: Sync workflow; content upload
* **Ansible**: Sync workflow (role & collection)
* **Container**: Sync workflow
* **Python**: Sync workflow

## Cloud Storage

It is possible to configure Pulp to use
[cloud storage](https://docs.pulpproject.org/pulpcore/installation/storage.html).
However, plugins can introduce changes that are incompatible with, for example, S3 requirements.
The Pulp Ansible, RPM, File, Debian, Python, and Container plugins are regularly tested to ensure they remain compatible but the
level of coverage is lower for other plugins.

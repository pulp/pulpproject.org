## Content Plugins

![](/images/pulp-workflow-architecture-ha/pulp-overview.png)

As part of the Pulp installation, you must add a content plugin for each content type that you want
to manage. The following sections contain information about the available content plugins. If you do
not find the plugin for the content type you want to manage, consider 
[writing a plugin](https://docs.pulpproject.org/plugins/plugin-writer/index.html).

## Plugin Changes between Pulp 2 and Pulp 3

* The ISO content support found in the Pulp 2 RPM plugin is now provided by the File plugin.
* The Docker plugin in Pulp 2 has been replaced by the Container plugin.
* Currently, there is no Pulp 3 plugin for Puppet content.

## Pulp 3 CLI Coverage

The [Pulp 3 CLI](https://github.com/pulp/pulp-cli) is continuously being expanded.
The CLI is implemented by the plugin writers, so the workflows that are possible with the CLI vary
from plugin to plugin.
Please check the CLI directly to see the current workflow coverage for the desired plugin.

## Role Based Access Control Support

While the functionality is available in Pulpcore, each plugin must add it separately.
Please check whether the plugin of your interest has already added RBAC support.

## Cloud Storage

It is possible to configure Pulp to use 
[cloud storage](https://docs.pulpproject.org/pulpcore/installation/storage.html). However, plugins
can introduce changes that are incompatible with, for example, S3 requirements. A number of plugins
are regularly tested to ensure they remain compatible but the level of coverage might not cover our
entire matrix of plugins.

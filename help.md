### Chat to us

With the recent developments with Freenode IRC, Pulp is currently transitioning towards becoming a primarily Matrix-based community with a bridge to Libera chat for any users who prefer to continue to use IRC.
Our Freenode IRC channels are still active and can be accessed through a Matrix bridge.
We will keep this page updated as we move.
If you have any feedback about this that you think we should consider, please open a new discussion on [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/pulp/pulpcore/discussions).

There is a Matrix [Pulp Community page](https://riot.im/app/#/group/+pulp:matrix.org) that lists all of the Pulp rooms.

* Join [**#pulp** on **irc.freenode.net**](https://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=#pulp) for User support.

Freenode](https://freenode.net/kb/answer/registration).

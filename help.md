## Pulp Community Discourse

We are currently trialling a move away from mailing lists as a primary method of communication.

At the moment, we are trialling our very own [Pulp Community Discourse](https://discourse.pulpproject.org).

Feel free to ask and answer questions, give feedback about your experience working with any aspect of Pulp. Introduce yourself, your project, what you're hoping to achieve with Pulp. We would be delighted to hear from you and understand how Pulp is helping.

If you like our Discourse, let us know! 

## Mailing List
Ask questions, discuss bugs, or use cases on the
[Pulp mailing list](https://www.redhat.com/mailman/listinfo/pulp-list). You
can also [read the archives](https://www.redhat.com/archives/pulp-list/).

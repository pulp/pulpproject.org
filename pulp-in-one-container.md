The quickest way to get started with Pulp is [multi-process image](https://docs.pulpproject.org/pulp_oci_images/multi-process-images/) that has all necessary services to run Pulp 3. It is intended to cover as many use cases for small-scale Pulp deployments.

If you prefer multiple containers, we have [pulp-operator](https://docs.pulpproject.org/pulp_operator/), which is robust but requires a Kubernetes Infrastructure. We also have a [Podman Compose / Docker Compose](/podman-compose/) deployment option to run the [single-process image](https://docs.pulpproject.org/pulp_oci_images/multi-process-images/), however it is intended as a proof-of-concept, and you will likely need to modify the Compose file for your needs.

The multi-process image is available under the `pulp` namespace on [Dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/pulp/pulp/). This image includes the Ansible, Container, Deb, File, Maven, Python, and RPM plugins. A new version is published every time there is a plugin update available. You can update your environment to the latest version of the container using `podman pull`.

If you experience any problems, check the [Known Issues](https://docs.pulpproject.org/pulp_oci_images/multi-process-images/#known-issues) section for workarounds, and file an [issue on Github](https://github.com/pulp/pulp-oci-images/issues). If you have any questions, feel free to reach out to us via [discourse](https://discourse.pulpproject.org/) or the [pulp](/help/#chat-to-us) channel on Matrix.

You can use either `podman` or `docker`. If you use `docker`, substitute `docker` for `podman` in the following examples.

The following commands can be used to start Pulp 3.4.1 with `podman 1.6.4`, which is available on
CentOS/RHEL 7 and later

```
$ mkdir settings pulp_storage pgsql containers
$ echo "CONTENT_ORIGIN='http://$(hostname):8080'
ANSIBLE_API_HOSTNAME='http://$(hostname):8080'
ANSIBLE_CONTENT_HOSTNAME='http://$(hostname):8080/pulp/content'
CACHE_ENABLED=True" >> settings/settings.py
```

## With SELinux

For systems with SELinux in enforcing mode, use the following command to start Pulp:

```
$ podman run --detach \
             --publish 8080:80 \
             --name pulp \
             --volume "$(pwd)/settings":/etc/pulp:Z \
             --volume "$(pwd)/pulp_storage":/var/lib/pulp:Z \
             --volume "$(pwd)/pgsql":/var/lib/pgsql:Z \
             --volume "$(pwd)/containers":/var/lib/containers:Z \
             --device /dev/fuse \
             pulp/pulp
```

## Without SELinux

For systems without SELinux in enforcing mode, use the following command to start Pulp:

```
$ podman run --detach \
             --publish 8080:80 \
             --name pulp \
             --volume "$(pwd)/settings":/etc/pulp \
             --volume "$(pwd)/pulp_storage":/var/lib/pulp \
             --volume "$(pwd)/pgsql":/var/lib/pgsql \
             --volume "$(pwd)/containers":/var/lib/containers \
             --device /dev/fuse \
             pulp/pulp
```

In both cases, you will see the following output. The last line contains the container ID that you can use to execute commands inside the container.

```

Note that the container ID is unique to your deployment.

Use the container ID to reset the `admin` user's password. `podman` also accepts the first part
of the ID for convenience.

```
$ podman exec -it pulp bash -c 'pulpcore-manager reset-admin-password'
Please enter new password for user "admin":
Please enter new password for user "admin" again:
Successfully set password for "admin" user.
```

At this point, both the REST API and the content app are available on your host's port `8080`. Try
hitting the pulp status endpoint to confirm:

```
curl localhost:8080/pulp/api/v3/status/
```

To start working with Pulp, check out the [Workflows and Use Cases](https://docs.pulpproject.org/workflows/index.html).
For individual plugin documentation, see [Pulp 3 Content Plugin Documentation](/docs/#pulp-3-content-plugin-documentation).


## Pulp CLI

We recommend using [pulp-cli](https://github.com/pulp/pulp-cli) to interact with Pulp. If you have
Python 3 installed on the host OS, you can run these commands to get started:

```
pip install pulp-cli[pygments]
pulp config create --username admin --base-url http://localhost:8080 --password <admin password>
```

Then you should be able to execute commands such as `pulp status`.
